# Encryption Protocol

Draft legal framework under Dutch law 31 October 2022

This protocol can be drafted by either a controller and/or a processor
 
### Part I - General

## 1. Scope

*(The "Scope" of a document explains the situations in which the document applies and how it is to be applied. Also, here it will clarify whether there are interactions between this protocol and others).*

This protocol applies to <…> (*This needs to state the scope of the processing to which the protocol applies. In general, this can be either all the processing by the entity completing the protocol or it could be a subset of the processing (for example a specific project that requires its own set of rules)* by USER.

This protocol interacts with the following documents:

• <…> (*This needs to refer to the documents and protocols already in place. These can be: Personal Data Breach Protocols; Testing Protocol; Disaster Recovery Protocol; General Data Processing Protocol or Policy, etc).*

In the event encryption is involved in the processing of personal data by USER either in its capacity as controller or as processor under the GDPR, in addition to Parts I and V of this protocol, Parts II, III and IV of this protocol apply. 

## 2. Encryption 

USER implements encryption as both a technical and organisational measure to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

USER further implements encryption in order to make sure that (personal) data is unintelligible to any person unauthorised to access such (personal) data.

USER implements encryption as an organisational measure in the following manner: (*This should state the manner in which encryption is implemented as an organisational measure).*

USER implements encryption as a technical measure in the following manner: (*This should state the manner in which encryption is implemented as a technical measure).*

USER has the following procedures in place in order to protect its encryption keys: (*This should state the manner in which encryption keys are protected.)*

USER implements different levels and types of encryption depending on risk to specific (personal) data as well as on whether (personal) data is at rest or in motion.

### 2.1. (Personal) Data at rest

(Personal) Data is considered to be at rest when the (personal) data are static and not moving anywhere. When (personal) data is at rest, USER implements encryption in the following manner: <…> (*This should provide a clear technical description of the measures taken to encrypt personal data at rest)*.

### 2.2. (Personal) Data in motion

(Personal) Data in motion refer to a stream of (personal) data moving through any kind of network. When (personal) data is in motion, USER implements encryption in the following manner: <…> (*This should provide a clear technical description of the measures taken to encrypt personal data in motion)*.

### Part II USER as controller and/or processor of personal data under the GDPR

## 3. General

USER may process personal data both as controller and/or as processor under the GDPR. Consequently, when the GDPR applies, in processing personal data, USER shall evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. This policy amongst others serves to comply with the requirements of article 6 (4) (e), 32 (1) (a) GDPR, and, when USER acts as controller, article 34 (3) (a) GDPR.

### Part III USER as controller of personal data under the GDPR

## 4. Encryption and notification of personal data breaches as controller

When and where USER processes personal data as a controller and in order to be able to comply with article 34 (3) (a) GDPR, USER shall implement encryption as appropriate that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, and shall ensure that such measures are applied in that manner if the personal data is affected by a personal data breach.

Where USER processes personal data as a controller, USER shall handle encryption issues involving a personal data breach in accordance with: (*This should link to an applicable personal data breach protocol)*.

### Part IV – USER as processor under the GDPR

## 5. Encryption and notification of personal data breaches as processor

Where USER processes personal data as a processor, USER shall handle encryption issues involving a personal data breach in accordance with the USER (Processor) Personal Data Breach Protocol <…>. (*This should link to an applicable personal data breach protocol)*.

### Part V – Miscellaneous

## 6. Evaluation

USER shall evaluate this protocol from time to time, taking into account <…> (*This should link to an applicable protocol)* for the purpose of providing an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the (personal) data to be protected. In the evaluation, USER shall consider the risks that are presented by (personal) data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, (personal) data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material or non-material damage.
USER shall, if the results of a periodic evaluation give cause, adapt this protocol to maintain an appropriate level of security.

## 7. Responsible person(s)

The responsibility for the execution of this protocol lies with <…>. (*This should state which person or department is responsible for the execution of this protocol.)*
The ultimate decision-making responsibility in connection with this protocol lies with <…>. (*This should state which person or department has ultimate decision making responsibility for this protocol.)*

## 8. Applicable law

*Determine the law that applies to the protocol. This can either be the national law where USER is established, or if the protocol is prepared for a project aimed at a specific country other than the country where USER is established, you may consider the law of the country where most of the users reside as an option. Also, include a determination of the court with jurisdiction based on these considerations. This will usually be a district court.*
