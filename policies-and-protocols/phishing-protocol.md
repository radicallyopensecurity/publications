# Phishing Response Protocol

Draft legal framework under Dutch law 31 October 2022

This protocol can be drafted by either a controller and/or a processor
 
Part I Instruction to all employees and contractors accessing USER systems, network and information, whether from USER’s or personal devices, in view of phishing

## 1. Instruction

This protocol is aimed at being more resilient to phishing attacks. Many phishing activities start with a phishing email. Therefore, this protocol instructs USER employees and contractors  in order to avoid phishing.

## 2. Scope

Phishing is a form of hostile online activity by which a sender, often making use of a fraudulent identity, entices a person into revealing (confidential or otherwise sensitive) information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like trojans or ransomware. Phishing can be defined as an attack borne by email or messaging application that attempts to get a user and their software to do something malicious without the user being aware of the malicious nature. Many attacks are an attempt to obtain sensitive information (such as passwords, financial information, configuration information, etc.) from an unsuspecting person. This happens by sending a message or an email with a link or attachment that appears to be from a legitimate source and requests action from the receiver.  

In the event a phishing incident involves the processing of personal data by USER either in its capacity as controller or as processor under the GDPR, in addition to Parts I and V of this protocol, Parts II, III and IV of this protocol apply. 

## 3. How to handle emails

First and foremost, please remain focused when handling messages, emails and web page (referrals) and keep check whether a received email is an expected email from an expected source. Remember, both the name of the sender and the email address of the sender can be fake(d)!  Never open attachments or follow directions in an unexpected email: do not follow a link or enter any information in a form or pop-up box in an unexpected email.

If the sender of an email is not known or recognised, their identity needs to be checked by hovering over the name of the sender when the email address cannot be seen to ensure the email address looks correct. Check the email carefully for errors like grammar or spelling mistakes. All of these can indicate a phishing email. Even if an email and its sender appear legitimate, but the topic or contents of the email are not expected, treat it with suspicion.

If an email is suspected of being a phishing email, do not open any attachments, follow links or directions in the email. Rather, notify the responsible person. In the meantime, quarantine or delete the email. < Question: Are suspicious emails quarantined or deleted?>. When possible, take a screen shot of the email and send it to the responsible person in a new email.

If the sender of the email is known but its contents aren’t trusted, first check by voice or video link whether that person truly sent the email and its attachments before acting on the email.
Documents received from an external source must only be opened in a read/only protected view.

Part II How USER seeks to avoid phishing

## 4. USER’s measures and activities to avoid phishing

<NOTE: USER should list here the measures and activities that it has in place to detect and avoid fishing such as system configurations, server protection and awareness programs and tests together with the frequency with which such measures are evaluated and changed.>.

## 5. Training

USER shall provide its employees and consultants with timely training on how to deal with phishing and similar security threats.
<NOTE: Please list the training modalities in place. Are there wikis providing internal information? Are there simulated phishing attacks?>.

## 6. Registration and notification 

### 6.1. Registration

USER shall register all phishing incidents in accordance with the applicable protocol. 

Part III USER as controller or processor of personal data under the GDPR

## 7. General

USER processes personal data both as controller and/or as processor. USER provides IT security services and in the context of its work may be exposed to a variety of, sometimes hostile, IT activities such as phishing. This protocol serves to comply, amongst others, with the requirements of article 25 (1) and 28 (1) GDPR. Phishing can result in, or involve a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

This protocol interacts with the following documents:

*This needs to refer to the documents and protocols already in place. These can be: Personal Data Breach Protocols; Testing Protocol; Disaster Recovery Protocol; General Data Processing Procol or Policy, etc.*

## 8. Detection and analysis

Phishing can affect the availability and integrity of personal data processed by USER. In order to implement data protection principles, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to protect the rights of data subjects, USER has the following measures in place to detect and analyse phishing attempts :
<PM>. USER has the following measures in place to detect successful phishing attacks <PM>.

## 9. Phishing and recovery

<NOTE: Include a description of your response to phishing, possibly linking it with disaster recovery protocols.>

  ## 10. Notification

Depending on the analysis of the consequences of a phishing attack, USER may need to notify external parties, which may include a supervisory authority. The way that USER shall fulfil its notification obligation depends on whether USER processes personal data as a controller or as a processor.

Part IV – USER as controller under the GDPR

Where USER processes personal data as a controller, USER shall register the phishing (attempt) in accordance with: *List the documents that you can refer to which deal with (potential) data breaches.* 

## 12. Notification and USER as controller

Where USER processes personal data as a controller, in a situation where a phishing attack may have resulted in a personal data breach, USER shall respond iList the documents that you can refer to which deal with (potential) data breaches.n accordance with the : *List the documents that you can refer to which deal with (potential) data breaches.*

Also, include a determination of the court with jurisdiction based on these considerations. This will usually be a district court.*
