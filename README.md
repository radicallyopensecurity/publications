# Publications

This repository contains Radically Open Security's generalized information security policies, GDPR protocols and an operational security guide with examples of best practices to take into consideration as an NLnet project grantee. These publications were also developed to help projects funded by the [NGI Zero Discovery](https://nlnet.nl/discovery) and [NGI Zero PET](https://nlnet.nl/PET) programs, which are part of the [Next Generation Internet](https://www.ngi.eu/) research and development initiative.
