# Publications

This repository contains examples of information security policies, GDPR documents, such as policies, protocols and (other) templates, and an operational security guide with examples of best practices. These publications were developed to help projects funded by the [NGI Zero Discovery](https://nlnet.nl/discovery) and [NGI Zero PET](https://nlnet.nl/PET) programs, which are part of the [Next Generation Internet](https://www.ngi.eu/) research and development initiative.
